Problem 1

Solve using javascript 

We have 3 trains moving on different railways from one station to another with the same
speed, every train has assigned different number of people. They need to circulate from
side to side on their own railway and in case 2 trains or more arrive to a cross at the
same time, the one with the higher number of people should pass first. The problem
consists in making the trains circulate on their railways avoiding collisions and falling the
priority rules. 

Note
- The space between stations are the same. 
- The starting point of every train should be passed in an init function. 
- This shouldnâ€™t be an application, just a written js logic.
- You may use console in dev tools to execute the code.
- There should be some indicators while code execution, which shows when the
collision is avoided.

Tip - Feel free to use all your coding superpowers to get the best results.
